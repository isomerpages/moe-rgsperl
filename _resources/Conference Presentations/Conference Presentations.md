<h2>Conference Presentations</h2><p>The staff at RGS regularly presents at conferences to share their expertise and stay current in their fields. Over the years, our educators have delivered presentations and workshops at a variety of international and local conferences. Their participation has allowed them to exchange ideas with peers and bring new insights back to apply in our classrooms.</p><p>A list of conferences attended by RGS staff over the past five years will be updated on our website soon. Please check back for details on their involvement in the conference circuit.</p>
