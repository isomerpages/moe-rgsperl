##### ABSTRACT:

The adoption of digital technology has redefined how we traditionally teach and assess Scientific concepts in

classroom. With the growing popularity amongst the youths in creating their own digital media (1), how might the use of audio editing and analyzing software enhance formative and summative assessments in a classroom?

This study aims to find out if this use of technology aids in improving the performance of high-ability students with varied learning needs in this topic. The study investigates the performance of Grade 8 students in a task that assesses their abilities to make use of concepts in Sound to edit and analyze various audio waveforms to create a specified podcast of a song. Students also create an accompanying poster to explain this creative and scientific process.  

Teachers’ feedback on the use of technology, as well as the pros and cons of creating and analyzing students’ podcasts using software will also be discussed.
