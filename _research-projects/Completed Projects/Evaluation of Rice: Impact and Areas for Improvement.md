##### ABSTRACT:

<img src="/images/azahar-rice.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
In 2014, RGS initiated a Regional Immersion and Community Exploration (RICE)
Programme for Year 2 students. It aims to achieve 4 outcomes: (i) global mindset, (ii) socio-cultural intelligence (iii) citizenship and (iv) reflective disposition. This study aims to assess the extent in which these stated outcomes were achieved. 

One important factor that will determine the success of RICE is teachers’ facilitation skills. As such, the study also aims to assess teachers’ competence in facilitation skills and identify challenges that they face. This study will outline areas for improvements for RICE 2015.
