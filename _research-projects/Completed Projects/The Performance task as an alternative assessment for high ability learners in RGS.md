##### ABSTRACT:

The objective of this research is to identify the key issues of using Performance Tasks (PT) as an alternative mode of assessment through teachers’ and students’ perceptions. The research was conducted at Raffles Girls’ School (RGS), an independent secondary school for high-ability females in Singapore.

A key innovation in RGS is a school-based assessment framework that features multiple assessment modes such as the Performance Task. This paper examines the teachers' beliefs and attitudes that shaped their curricular practices as they implemented the PT as an alternative assessment. Students’ perception and attitudes were also taken into account. Thus, the findings can inform educators about the quality of teaching and learning that the PT contributes to.   

The research followed a sequential exploratory strategy in which focus group interviews and surveys for teachers and students were conducted. Inferences were drawn from the data analysis and used to make recommendations to educators within the school and beyond on how Performance Tasks should be designed, administered, supervised and graded.

Findings revealed that teachers and students recognised the Performance Task as a multi-dimensional and integrated approach to assessments, providing real-world scenarios for students to demonstrate their communication skills as well as critical and creative thinking skills. The study also identified challenges in the implementation of the Performance Task and crafting of the rubrics.

This study identifies adaptive measures that are needed to ensure consistency of practices in the school-wide implementation of the Performance Task.The objective of this research was to identify the key issues of using Performance Tasks (PT) as an alternative mode of  assessment through teachers’ and students’ perceptions.
