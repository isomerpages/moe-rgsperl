<img src="/images/ram 2011 evaluation.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
The 5 Year 2 classes currently equipped with iPads and MacBooks are another pilot test for 1:1 in the RGS context, similar to the MacBook-equipped Year 3 classes in 2010.  We will be collecting both qualitative and quantitative data to assess the impact the devices have had on the teaching and learning in these classes.
