##### ABSTRACT

Academic discourse centrally involves interpersonal negotiation of meaning and dialogistic positioning. This study will examine how teachers engage their readers in research articles (RAs). Through a series of quantitative and qualitative textual analyses, this study will adopt Martin and White's (2005) Appraisal Theory to discuss how disciplinarity can influence writers' use of engagement resources and their expression of stance. Our presentation will make explicit how classroom practitioners with different disciplinary backgrounds use engagement resources in writing for publication as well as how they may use these engagement resources in their lesson planning so that they facilitate knowledge building within the classroom.
