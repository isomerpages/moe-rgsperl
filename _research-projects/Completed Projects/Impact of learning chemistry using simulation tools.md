##### ABSTRACT:

<img src="/images/Simulation tools.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
ICT-enabling tools such as simulation software are widely used in the learning of Chemistry to help students visualize microscopic phenomenon. In the learning of the topic Rate of Reaction, Collision Theory is used to explain how the factors affect the rate of reaction. Students are required to visualize particles’ interaction and infer how changes in factors such as temperature or concentration affects the rate of collisions between the particles leading to changes in rate of reaction. Little research has been done to evaluate the effectiveness of chemical modelling tools like simulation software in improving students’ results. This research aims to find out whether students’ learning improved using simulation software.
