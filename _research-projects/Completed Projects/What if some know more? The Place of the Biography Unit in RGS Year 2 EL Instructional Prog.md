This is an RGS English Department’s practitioner inquiry on their Year 2 Biography

Unit.  Students from Gifted Education Programme (GEP) in primary school would have experienced this genre in Primary 5, so does the Biography Unit have a place in RGS English Language instructional programme?  

To address this inquiry, a pre-unit self-report was conducted to get a sense of students’ knowledge of the genre of biography. The resulting findings were generated by comparing responses from GE students with responses from non-GE students.  Based on these responses, four competencies that an apprentice biographer would develop were identified, and tasks for each competency were designed for students to engage in.  Students are then allowed to set targets and decide what tasks to do, and how much to do.  In August 2016, students will submit evidence of learning and this work will be assessed.  The data from this assessment could provide information on design for differentiation by interest and/or readiness level, as well as information about pedagogy in the English Language classroom.
