##### ABSTRACT:

<img src="/images/kinematics.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
Kinematics graphs tell the story of the motion of objects without using words but yet most beginning Physics students seems to have a disconnect between with the graphs and the motions of object. It is even apparent on students who have solid mathematical foundation such as gradient of graphs and graphical plotting skills. Students seem to have difficulties visualizing the graphs into motions of the objects and describing them. It is also confusing to students with many different graphs such as displacement-time, velocity-time and acceleration graphs. Most students also have difficulties in visualizing and converting the corresponding velocity/acceleration–time graphs when given displacement-time graph or vice-versa. Instead of going through the kinematics graph theories and hope that students can translate and visualize the motion of the objects, the presenter attempts to help students overcome this barrier by using different motions to plot and obtain the different kinematics graphs. With the help of technology, different actual movement profiles can be easily captured through motion sensors and videos to provide concrete data for students to infer, analyze and understand the concepts of kinematics and the graphs.
