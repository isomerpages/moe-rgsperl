##### ABSTRACT:

This project investigated the effect of the “Bring Your Own Device” (BYOD) system on students’ learning. Among the students in RGS, only the Year 4 batch was not involved in the RGS 1:1 practice of each student using their own Apple Macbooks to facilitate learning. Hence, they had to bring their own devices, mainly Windows OS devices, to the classroom. Two History classes, one Year 2 class of 34 students and one Year 4 class of 23 students, were involved in this project. In attempting a questionnaire, students:<br>
(i) indicated the degree to which personal computing devices enhanced various aspects of student learning;<br>
(ii) ranked devices according to which best suited their learning needs; and<br>
(iii) ranked devices according to their preference in carrying out certain learning-related tasks.<br>
Students in general found BYOD to be helpful in their learning, with Year 2s ranking BYOD as more effective than Year 4s. Most students ranked laptops of Mac and Windows OS as their preferred smart device for learning.
