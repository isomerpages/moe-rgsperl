##### ABSTRACT:

<img src="/images/value of class paerticipation.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
Existing data captured from the RGS 1:1 programme evaluation framework indicates a high level of student  attainment vis-à-vis programme goals. They also indicate a fair level of attainment with regards to teacher achievements vis-à-vis programme goals.   There is however no co-relational mechanism to establish the relationship between student attainment and teacher use of ICT in the classroom. As a result, the impact of ICT use on student learning is not captured. 

Given that the teacher plays a primary role in implementing RGS 1:1, there is a need to ascertain teacher beliefs towards technology use. Concomitantly, the gap (if any) between teacher belief and the extent of use of ICT needs to be captured.
