##### ABSTRACT:

<img src="/images/developing higher tamil pupil.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
The research aims to improve the students' point-of-view essay writing skills. This is important as students need to know how a problem can be looked at from various points of views. Students also need to be able to think critically, which is a demand in the world they are growing up in. Students also need to be able to apply these skills in real-life situations. Critical thinking and point-of-view takes shape in my department in the form of essay writing. It is an important aspect in the upper secondary lessons and I feel that teaching such skills is a teacher's duty. I have addressed it in the form of classroom activities during my lesson periods. The objective of this research is to improve students' ability to look at a problem from various perspectives and to improve their skills in expressing their thoughts through their written work clearly. Research questions: What are the reasons attributing to the students' low levels of ability in thinking critically and in expressing their point of views? What are the methods to improve the students' skills in doing so?

This project was in collaboration with Crescent Girls' School.
