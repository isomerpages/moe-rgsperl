<img src="/images/Art.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
This study investigates the use of a new approach to designing General Art Program for Y2 students taking the Art and Design Module in 2015. The new approach involves designing a series of connected lessons to enable students to conceptualise ideas from a given theme, developing it into a visual representation and executing the final artwork using relevant artmaking skills taught to them. The purpose of this study is to find out if using conceptual approach in designing the art program enhances student learning and performance. Data collection from this year's new art program will be analysed quantitatively as well as qualitatively and compared with that of last year's old art program. The sources of data comes from students survey, teachers survey as well as the assessment grades of the students' works. The outcome of this study will be used for review and improvement of the Art program for subsequent years.
