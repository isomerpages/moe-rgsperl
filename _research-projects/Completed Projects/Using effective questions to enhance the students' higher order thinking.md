This study investigates whether effective questions would enhance students’ higher order thinking. The study focused on Lower Secondary students: Secondary 1 Express Chinese students from Jurong West Secondary School, Secondary 2 Express Chinese students from Yuan Ching Secondary School, and Secondary 1 Higher Chinese students from Raffles Girls’ Secondary. Teachers crafted questions using questioning and reflective strategies and used verbal and written mediums to expose students to these questions. Via a pre- and post- investigation test, teachers then evaluated students’ improvements in higher order thinking. Many students were found to have improved during the course of the study, understanding how to examine questions from different angles and answer questions precisely and fully.

This project was in collaboration with the Ministry of Education (MOE).
