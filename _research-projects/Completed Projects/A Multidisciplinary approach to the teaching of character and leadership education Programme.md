##### ABSTRACT:

<img src="/images/CLE.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
The implementation of the Character and Leadership Education (CLE) programme is often perceived to be separate from the teaching of academic subjects. This is despite the fact that the application of academic skills and knowledge is often relevant to character building - a process that requires an authentic context for students to develop character, cultivate values and hone leadership skills. A multidisciplinary approach provides such a context for bridging the teaching of academic subjects and CLE programme. In this research, we aim to investigate how effective the use of a multidisciplinary approach in a speech assessment task had been in providing an opportunity for students to explore issues of leadership, ethics and civics in the context of social advocacy. In this speech task, students assumed the role of an advocate to address a social issue through the multiple disciplinary lenses of English Language, Social Studies and Philosophy. Additionally, we are keen to explore the question of whether an interdisciplinary approach, which involves the “integration and even modification of the disciplinary sub-contributions” (Petrie, 1976) would have been more effective an approach.
