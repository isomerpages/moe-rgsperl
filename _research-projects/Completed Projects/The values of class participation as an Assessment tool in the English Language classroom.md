##### ABSTRACT:

<img src="/images/Class participation.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
Class participation is commonly graded in some subject classrooms, particularly the soft disciplines. However, teacher understanding of what class participation entails may not be uniform due to a variety of factors (such as differing levels of teaching experience, differences in disciplinary background, differing notions of class participation based on personal experience). This study, conducted in an Integrated Programme school in Singapore, examines the considerations of English Language teachers in accepting or rejecting class participation as an assessment tool. It discusses the pedagogical and theoretical implications of continuing with the use of class participation as an assessment tool, and makes recommendations on how to grade class participation in a valid and reliable manner, based on qualitative data collected from focus group interviews and stimulated recall sessions. This study should be of interest to teachers from the soft disciplines, who may be interested in exploring if there is value in continuing with class participation as an assessment tool, as well as teachers in general, who may be interested in finding out if class participation facilitates learning in their subject-based classroom, given the particular knowledge structure of each discipline and its accompanying set of epistemological beliefs.
