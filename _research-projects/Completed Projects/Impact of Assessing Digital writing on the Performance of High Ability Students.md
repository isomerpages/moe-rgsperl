##### ABSTRACT:

The introduction of digital technology in the English Language classroom has redefined how we traditionally teach and assess writing. Writing proficiency is no longer merely measured by the quality of content and the mechanics of writing, but includes, one’s ability to complement the intended message using multimedia. Digital writing, unlike traditional writing, which is passive and solitary, facilitates interaction between reader, writer and the medium (Ferris, 2002). This study aims to find out if the use of technology aids in improving the writing proficiency of high-ability students with varied language learning needs. Does writing electronically have an impact on the performance of these students? This study investigates the performance of Grade 9 students in a blog writing task that assesses the four components content, language, use of multimedia and the posting of online comments. Apart from analyzing students’ scores for the blog writing task, the study also examines teachers’ feedback on the use of technology in the assessment of the task. The results of this study will be useful to practitioners and teacher educators who intend to see the benefits of including technology in their language lessons.
