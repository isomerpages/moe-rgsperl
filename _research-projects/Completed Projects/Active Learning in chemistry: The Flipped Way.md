##### ABSTRACT:

As teachers, we constantly face the uphill battle in trying to incorporate inquiry- based activity while fulfilling the need to prepare the students adequately for standardized testing. Considerable time is often spent on pre-laboratory briefing, resulting in less time for students to engage in actual science experimentation. In addition, we often overlook the importance of historical development of scientific knowledge in developing traits and attitudes of being a scientist. Recently, the flip classroom model has generated much excitement in the education fraternity with the promise of increased class time for active learning through more engaging activities. In order to maximize face-to-face interactions with students, we have adopted the flipped classroom model since the beginning of this year. This model allows teachers to spend class time on more inquiry activities, hands-on experimentations and the discussion of historical development of scientific knowledge. In the flipped instructional model, students are assigned pre-class materials to access at home, either in the form of videos, textbook or articles. Classroom learning will be a follow-up from the pre-class activity and typically involve an inquiry activity that engages students in problem solving and collaborative learning. This model of instruction frees up more time for active learning in the classroom. It prepares our students to be self-directed learners and active contributors in the 21st century. As compared to the traditional  teacher- centered methods, we now see an increase in student-student and student-teacher interaction. This study will involve the gathering of qualitative data on students’ responses and feedback towards flipped learning and this is carried out via written surveys after the completion of each topic.
