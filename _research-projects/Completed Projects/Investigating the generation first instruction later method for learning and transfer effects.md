##### ABSTRACT:

<img src="/images/Generation first1.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
Using a 2x2 experimental design, this study investigated the effects of generative tasks that involve analogical reasoning on learning and transfer. Pedagogical sequence (i.e., generation-first or instruction-first) and type of analogical reasoning task (i.e., generating one’s own analogies or generating analogical mappings between given analogies) were the two factors manipulated. Preliminary analysis suggests that students who generated analogies themselves, prior to receiving direct instruction, performed better in learning and transfer, as compared to students who received instruction first or who generated analogical mappings between given analogies. These findings expand the understanding of how _Productive Failure_ and related learning designs affect learning and transfer.

This project was in collaboration with the National Institute of Education (NIE).
