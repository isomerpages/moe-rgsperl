<img src="/images/cooperative learning.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
Cooperative Learning involves students working together in small groups to accomplish share goals (Gillies, R., 2007). This study aims to find out how cooperative learning contributes to effective student learning in terms of mastery of content knowledge and development of socio-affective skills. This study is carried out in History, Physics and Philosophy lessons with 3 classes of Year 1 students. The main research methods for this study are:<br>

1 \.  Post-lesson surveys in which students evaluate their contributions to the group and their learning, as well as their peers’ contributions to the group;<br>
2 \.  Teachers’ observations and reflections.

The findings from this study will be useful to teachers who are interested to find out the benefits of cooperative learning.
