Learning Journey programs are implemented for Higher Malay students based on the Experiential Learning and National Education messages. The program emphasizes taking the learning process and experience beyond the classroom, but still keeping it rooted to the curriculum. The students from the lower and upper secondary level were brought to visit places of Malay culture and heritage in Singapore. This sharing reports the findings of the qualitative study which investigated the effectiveness of these programs by analyzing students’ writing and reflection. This study explored if the programs provided opportunity for students’ active engagement in an authentic setting and thus, created deep and meaningful learning. It also explored if the students were able to make conscious application of their learning to the curriculum.
