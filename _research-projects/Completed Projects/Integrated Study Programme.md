<img src="/images/integrated programme study_moe logo.jpg" style="width:40%" align=right>

The purpose of this study is to:<br>
1 \.  Offer insights on the impact of school-based innovations<br>
2 \.  Enable IP schools to take stock of their own progress & plan forward<br>
3 \.  Guide the expansion of IP<br>
The logic model will be used to show what the programme aims to accomplish by examining the chain of connections; i.e., how the Programme investments and inputs contribute to the outputs and hence, the outcomes. The outcomes are examined in terms of the short term, medium & long term.
