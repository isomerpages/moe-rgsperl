<img src="/images/blooms taxonomy.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
This exploratory study seeks to develop an understanding on how teachers plan and implement differentiated instruction to address the needs of high ability diverse learners in a regular classroom. This study seeks to gain insight into teachers’ understanding on differentiated instruction, the enablers and their challenges faced when implementing it.

Using a qualitative case study research design, teachers’ understanding on differentiated instruction was investigated through one to one interviews, lesson observations and document analysis. A document analysis was undertaken of the school’s professional development plans. By gaining insights into the actual implementation of differentiated instruction for high ability learners, school administrators and professional development department will understand how teachers use differentiated instruction. The findings will provide input to the professional development department to address concerns and challenges that teachers might face and support teachers in developing competency in differentiated instruction. This research would also attempt to develop and establish baseline standards for differentiated instruction and provide input for benchmarking so that there will be standardized teacher expectations on the implementation of differentiated instruction.
