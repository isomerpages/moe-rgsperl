##### ABSTRACT:

<img src="/images/teachers use of evaluative resources.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
To explore linguistic aspects of crafting evaluative reports and whether teaching experience and disciplinary background have an effect on teachers' use of evaluative language on their written feedback (i.e., evaluative reports) on students' academic work. This study hopes to shed light on how as educators, we can give effective feedback and address the affective development of our students through the effective use of various evaluative resources available.
