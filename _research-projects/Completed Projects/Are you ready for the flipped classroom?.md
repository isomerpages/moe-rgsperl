##### ABSTRACT:

<img src="/images/flip classroom.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
The flipped classroom creates opportunities to move explicit instruction out of curriculum time; and the remaining time in class for differentiated instruction, peer collaboration and developing higher order thinking skills. This study focuses the investigation of using flipped classroom pedagogy to build mathematical comprehension skills and classroom discourse. More specifically, (i) the selection of mathematical content, (ii) the medium through which the content is presented and (iii) the practice of thinking routines will be discussed. The conclusion of the study is drawn from the data collected and analyzed from the classroom experiences of 55 students. These findings can be perceived from two perspectives: how can teachers help learners optimize their learning; and to what extent do learners feel empowered and supported in their learning in the flipped classroom?
