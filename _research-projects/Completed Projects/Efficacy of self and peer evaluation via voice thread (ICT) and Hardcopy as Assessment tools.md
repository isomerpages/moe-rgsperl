##### ABSTRACT:

<img src="/images/efficacy of self voice thread.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
Assessment for learning （Black and William, 1998; Black et al, 2003）aims to change teachers’ classroom practice that can make teaching and learning more effective. This article reports a research on the efficacy of the use of self and peer evaluation rubrics via ICT tool (Voice Thread)and conventional method (hard-copy) to develop student’s self-evaluation and peer-evaluation skills in order to improve their skills in scenario writing. The study was undertaken with Year 2 Higher Chinese students，aged 13-14, from Raffles Girls’ Secondary School (Singapore). It involved 51 students from 2 classes, which comprised of 1 class of 1-to-1 learning environment using Mac book and 1 class of traditional classroom setting.

The students will adopt a systematic approach in their evaluation and reflection: upload an essay-> evaluating others' essays -> monitoring -> planning -> self evaluating -> re-write the essay based on feedback, with greater amount of attention devoted to the monitoring strategy.

The intervention focused on scaffolding students in reflection of their written essay via self evaluation and peer evaluation. The main sources of data came from  Voice Thread’s recordings (class 210) and hard-copy rubrics (class 201). We will use the mean scores of the pre- to post-test of scenario writing as a means to indicate the benefits of this approach.

This project was in collaboration with the Ministry of Education (MOE).
