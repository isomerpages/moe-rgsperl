<img src="/images/Video Cooking.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
Before students start cooking, they have to watch the teacher do cooking demonstration.  Though it is done at the students’ pace and students’ queries are answered, there have been cases when students forget certain steps to a skill.   Some will approach the teacher during their practical while there are others who continue with incorrect step, often affecting the final product. This project aims to provide opportunity for students to watch the video prepare for their practical prior to the actual lessons, allow students to air questions prior to their practical session based on the video demo that they have watched, enable teachers to give students timely feedback even before they begin cooking, give students access to the demo and for students to be able to learn at their own pace and provide instructional resource for teachers and students outside the domain of the school kitchen.
