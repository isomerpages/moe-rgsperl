##### ABSTRACT:

<img src="/images/DI.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
Students, regardless of their culinary abilities cook/bake the same dishes.  As a result, some exceptional students may find  practical activities insufficiently challenging. This PI hopes to identify these students, hone their skills and allow them to be creative. Hence, activities and assignments (practical) are designed to accommodate the learning needs of high achieving learners (HALs). These include adjustments to process and product based on student's time management, creativity and manipulative skills.

Research Questions:<br>
1 \. How can we identify students with higher ability in culinary skills in the kitchen?<br>
2 \. How do we provide opportunities to hone higher ability students' interest in cooking/baking?<br>
3 \. How can we facilitate DI among HALs through SDL?

Steps for investigation:<br>
1 \. Identify HALs using simple rubrics eg. time management, creativity, manipulative skills<br>
2 \. Provide additional resources to allow room for creativity<br>
3 \. Facilitate their inquisitive minds through extra consultation
