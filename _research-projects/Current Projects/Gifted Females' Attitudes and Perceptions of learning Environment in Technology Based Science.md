<img src="/images/sundari_tech_Science.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
The proposed research study will utilize the Technology-Rich Outcomes-Focused Learning Environment Inventory (TROFLEI) and an attitude questionnaire to examine differences between gifted females in ICT-based and regular classrooms in terms of students’ attitudes and perceptions of the learning environment. The study will also investigate the associations between student attitudes and the classroom learning environment. The sample will consist of approximately 800 school students (400 in ICT-based classrooms and 400 in regular classrooms) in Grades 9 and 10, respectively, in a secondary school in Singapore.

The objectives of the proposed study are:<br>
1 \.  to investigate whether the TROFEI and an attitude questionnaire are valid and reliable for assessing classroom learning environments and attitudes, respectively, when used with gifted female students in a secondary school in Singapore;<br>
2 \.  to investigate differences between ICT-based science classrooms and regular science classrooms in terms of students’ attitudes and perceptions of classroom learning environment;<br>
3 \.  to investigate associations between student attitudes and the classroom learning environment
