This is a comparative study involving two schools in which all students take Philosophy from Years 1 to 4. The
<img src="/images/eryang_shujuin_COI.jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
Community of Inquiry (COI) is a key feature of the Philosophy programme in both schools as the COI skills and dispositions are identified as learner outcomes. This study aims to address the following questions through analysing transcriptions of video recordings of COI discussions

Primary Question:<br>
1 \.  Are there any differences between students in both schools in terms of the attainment of COI learner outcomes?

Secondary Questions:<br>
1 \.  Given that Philosophy has more curriculum time in one school, does the amount curriculum time have an effect on the attainment of COI learner outcomes?<br>
2 \.  Given that Y1 and Y2 Philosophy in one of the schools have smaller class sizes than the other, do smaller class sizes have an effect on the attainment of COI learner outcomes?

This project was in collaboration with Raffles Institution.
