##### ABSTRACT:

<img src="/images/effective questioning effective learning (1).jpg" style="width:49%" align=right>
This meta-analysis aims to map out the pedagogical principles and the added value of thinking in curriculum design. By analyzing different independent studies, the meta-analysis seeks to undertake a systematic review and evaluation of the theory-based frameworks, models and taxonomies of thinking.

An analysis matrix will be developed that will map out and establish patterns and relationships between the various thinking frameworks and taxonomies. A deeper understanding of how people think and learn will strengthen the theory-practice nexus in RGS. A comprehensive map of thinking frameworks and skills will allow teachers to have a common understanding of the various theories, frameworks and thinking constructs. It will equip them with the meta-language when they discuss about thinking skills, and update their theoretical knowledge that will inform their practice. The understanding gained from the meta-analysis will also provide insights into our current curriculum design, instruction and professional learning, and allows for an evaluation of the current thinking programmes in RGS. A set of recommendations covering research provisions, staff development and classroom instructions will be made.
