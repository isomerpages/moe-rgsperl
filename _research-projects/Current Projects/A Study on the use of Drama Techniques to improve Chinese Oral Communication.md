communication skills in a Chinese classroom. A UbD lesson plan that incorporates drama strategies for oral communication will be designed and implemented. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected. Pre test and post test scores as well as students’ feedback will be analysed to find out the effectiveness of the use of drama strategies to improve oral communication skills. The findings will show how drama and theatre strategies can be combined with current affairs and new textbook syllabus to improve oral communication in students.

The lesson unit demonstrated that students exposed to lessons incorporated with drama elements and real life scenarios (such as current affairs) and/or new textbook syllabus will engaged students to participate actively in the role playing scenario, thereby helping them to reflect and develop their oral communication skills.  
  
The findings will benefit the Year 1 Higher Chinese cohort and Year 1 to 4 Chinese classes next year if the lesson plan is implemented level wide.
