On 18th October 2018, a two member team of PeRL, comprising Mrs Mary George Cheriyan, Deputy Principal (PeRL & Community Engagement) and Ms Tan Yen Chuan, a teacher specialist,  successfully conducted an international special workshop on “Developing a Professional Learning Community (PLC)”, for Thai educators at EDUCA 2018, Bangkok, Thailand.

The workshop shared practical ideas on how to facilitate PLC, using the case study of a school with a culture of collaboration and professional sharing. At the end of the workshop, participants were encouraged to come up with a start-up plan for their own PLC that satisfy their respective individual needs.
