<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>I. Research in RGS</strong>
</p>
<p>The PeRL Research Academy steers educational research in RGS. As a research
office, it monitors research standards and ethics, providing the infrastructure
for reflective practice for staff.</p>
<p>All staff who embark on research are required to submit the RGS Research
Plan in which they indicate the research purpose, design and methodology.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>RGS Research Academy Handbook</strong>&nbsp;provides
information and guidelines for all research-related information, which
includes the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Research Categories</strong>
</p>
<p>Research in RGS consists of 2 categories:&nbsp;<strong>School-Wide Research</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Practitioner Inquiry</strong>.
The info-graphic below describes Practitioner Inquiry in RGS.</p>

<p><strong>II. School-Wide Research Projects</strong>
</p>
<p>PeRL-conducted School-Wide Research focuses on:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Curriculum design</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instructional approaches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professional Practice</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following projects were conducted by the PeRL Research team:</p>
<p><strong>1 .</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Insights from Teachers’ Perspectives on Blended Learning in a Secondary School in Singapore: An Exploratory Study</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Impact: </strong>This study supports the school-wide adoption
of the Blended Learning pedagogical approach and the findings inform the
school’s professional learning plans. Findings from this case study have
shown that teachers have a strong and positive mindset towards Blended
Learning. The findings also sheds light on the areas of strength and areas
for growth in teacher readiness for Blended Learning. Recommendations are
put forth to address the challenges faced by teachers.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Role of a Professional Learning Community in Informing Teacher Practice: A Case Study in Raffles Girls School (2016 - 2018)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong>&nbsp;The research on the professional learning
community in RGS, known as the Professional Learning Space (PLS),&nbsp;showed
that&nbsp;the PLS has the strongest effect in developing teachers' assessment
literacy and curriculum design knowledge and skills. However, the findings
also highlighted the untapped potential of the PLS,&nbsp;such as in addressing
student learning needs through collective review of practices and facilitating&nbsp;teachers'
responsiveness to student learning. Based on the findings, the investigators
are actively&nbsp;engaging members of the staff to leverage the PLS for
more review practices which center on the evidence of student learning,
such as through the sharing of knowledge&nbsp;gained from practitioner
inquiry, discussing classroom practices with a student-centered perspective,
and utilizing student data to support classroom decision-making.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p><strong>III. Practitioner Inquiry Projects</strong>
</p>
<p>Teachers in RGS embark on Practitioner Inquiry projects to inform their
practice across diverse areas of disciplines and interests. There are protocols
to guide teachers embarking on Practitioner Inquiry projects and a PeRL
member is attached to each project to ensure that the teacher-researcher's
needs are met throughout the duration of the project.</p>
<p>The following are examples of Practitioner Inquiry projects that have
been completed by RGS teachers:</p>
<p><strong>1 .&nbsp;&nbsp; Mathematics Comprehension: Engaging students in Thinking about Mathematics&nbsp;(2021)</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Benefit to Practice:</u>&nbsp;In learning mathematics, the ability
to read and comprehend mathematical content materials is an essential skill
to deepen conceptual understanding, enable effective problem solving and
support independent learning. The findings illuminate the effects of building
mathematical comprehension skills on students’ attitudes towards Mathematics
learning.</p>
<p><strong>2 .&nbsp;Music, of Cause! Giving students a voice within and beyond the classroom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2014)</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Benefit to Practice:</u>&nbsp;The research allowed for a more rigorous
use of data / feedback (students, staff and SD team) in evaluating the
RICE Programme. Conclusions provide targeted focus on what went well, the
key areas to be improved and recommendations for RICE 2015.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Value of Class Participation as an Assessment Tool in the English Language Classroom&nbsp; (2013)</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Benefit to Practice:</u> Our investigative team was awarded the ELIS
Research Fund. Embarking on a Practitioner Inquiry honed our skills in
classroom research. The opportunity to present our findings at the ELIS
Conference 2015 was priceless. The discussions with fellow educators on
how we could further refine our existing assessment practices were truly
enriching.</p>
