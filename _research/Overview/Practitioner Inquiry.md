<p>Teachers in RGS embark on Practitioner Inquiry projects to inform their
practice across different disciplines and interests. There are protocols
to guide teachers embarking on Practitioner Inquiry projects, and a PeRL
member is attached to each project to ensure that the teacher-researcher's
needs are met throughout the duration of the project.</p>
<p>Practitioner Inquiry in RGS is conducted either through the Action Research
Approach or the Traditional Research Approach.</p>
<p>The diagrams below depict Practitioner Inquiry, as well as the Research
