## PRACTITIONER INQUIRY

Teachers in RGS embark on Practitioner Inquiry projects to inform their practice across different disciplines and interests. There are protocols to guide teachers embarking on Practitioner Inquiry projects, and a PeRL member is attached to each project to ensure that the teacher-researcher's needs are met throughout the duration of the project.  

Practitioner Inquiry in RGS is conducted either through the Action Research Approach or the Traditional Research Approach.

The diagrams below depict Practitioner Inquiry, as well as the Research Ecosystem in RGS.
