<h4>The Following Projects Were Conducted by the PeRL Research Team:</h4>
<p><strong>1 .</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Teacher Belief and Effective Use of Technology in Teaching &amp; Learning (2014)</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Impact:</u>&nbsp;The research on Teacher Belief and Effective use of
Technology showed that the teachers generally hold robust and tenacious
beliefs towards technology-enhanced teaching and learning. What teachers
require is closer attention to the pedagogical possibilities of the various
ICT platforms, linking specific ICT-enhanced instructional strategies with
the topic. Using these findings, the Learning Resources and Technology
team has adopted a needs-based professional development approach, focusing
primarily on good pedagogy and how it can be complemented by ICT tools.</p>
<p><strong>2 . &nbsp; &nbsp;Differentiated &nbsp;Instructions for High Ability Learners in a Regular Classroom: A Case Study in an Independant School (2015)</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Impact:</u>&nbsp;The research on differentiated &nbsp;instructions
for high ability learners showed that&nbsp;teachers generally practice
different forms of differentiation in the classroom. However, the findings
highlighted that while the needs of high and low ability learners were
catered to, more attention is needed to cater to the learning of the "middle
group" in the classroom. &nbsp;Using these findings, the investigators
were able to&nbsp;address concerns and challenges that teachers face in
implementing differentiation in the classroom. The investigators were also
able to support teachers in developing competency in differentiated instruction,
through the creation of a differentiation matrix for teachers' self-assessment
in their differentiation practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Role of a Professional Learning Community in Informing Teacher Practice: A Case Study in Raffles Girls School (2016 - 2017)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Impact:</u>&nbsp;The research on the professional learning community
in RGS, known as the Professional Learning Space (PLS),&nbsp;showed that&nbsp;the
PLS has the strongest effect in developing teachers' assessment literacy
and curriculum design knowledge and skills. However, the findings also
highlighted the untapped potential of the PLS, &nbsp;such as in addressing
student learning needs through collective review of practices and facilitating&nbsp;teachers'
responsiveness to student learning. Based on the findings, the investigators
are actively&nbsp;engaging members of the staff to leverage the PLS for
more review practices which center on the evidence of student learning,
such as through the sharing of knowledge&nbsp;gained from practitioner
inquiry, discussing classroom practices with a student-centered perspective,
and utilizing student data to support classroom decision-making.</p>
