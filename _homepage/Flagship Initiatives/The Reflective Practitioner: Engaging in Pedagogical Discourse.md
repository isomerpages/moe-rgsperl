The distinctive feature of this event was the Open Classroom concept. Sixteen RGS teachers opened their classrooms to over fifty teachers from other schools who attended their lessons as well as engaged in pedagogical conversations with them.

In the second part of the Symposium, Professor Lee Wing On, Dean of Education, National Institute of Education, gave a keynote address. He shared his experiences as a teacher who learnt   how to respond to his students’ needs through constant reflection and learning.

The keynote address was followed by a series of workshops on best practices and research findings. Out of 37 workshops that afternoon, 30 sessions were conducted by personnel from other organizations that included Chess Academy, Institute of Mental Health and Temasek Polytechnic.
