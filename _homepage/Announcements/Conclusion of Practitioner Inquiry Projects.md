From the Mathematics department, teachers Ms. Goh Li Meng and Mr. Samuel Lee were involved in a project “E-portfolio in Mathematics - Students Perceptions of Learning Mathematics". The study investigated the use of reflections in students’ Mathematics portfolio in helping students to self-assess their understanding and perceptions in learning Mathematics. The teachers also wanted to understand how the use of a Mathematics portfolio as a pedagogical tool can inform their practice, particularly in curriculum evaluation for the Mathematics Raffles Academy program for higher ability students.

Through their research, the teachers found that the e-portfolio has proven to be a platform where students could reflect, self-assess, re-look their learning journey and identify their struggles, strengths, weakness and potential. The teachers also found that the use of the e-portfolio, which includes students’ reflections on the assessments; their choice of the pieces of work in the portfolio; and the combination of traditional pen and paper assessments and alternative assessments, provided them avenues to conduct curriculum differentiation, self-directed learning activities, as well as peer learning initiatives. Through the e-portfolio, students also displayed a greater degree of self-awareness regarding their emotions associated with learning and assessments.

Their findings were presented in the Redesigning Pedagogy Conference.
