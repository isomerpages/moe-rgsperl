This intensive one-day workshop was specially customised to help RGS teachers continue to develop the knowledge, understanding, and skills necessary to design effective differentiation in the curriculum, formative assessments, classroom environment and management. During the workshop, active planning for student differences in classrooms was advocated whereby teachers reviewed and analyzed examples of strategies that can be effective for addressing student variance in readiness, interest, and learning profile.
