<p>Engagement with the educational fraternity has its roots in RGS PeRL Consultancy
which firmly believed in the&nbsp;<em>professional development</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>empowerment</em> of&nbsp;classroom
teachers with innovative strategies to educate high ability girls to be
leaders of tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;It endeavoured to create a&nbsp;<em>practitioner-oriented</em>&nbsp;learning
environment by offering a wide variety of professional development workshops
that cater to teachers' needs as adult learners.</p>
<p>The workshops, which focused on&nbsp;<em>evidence-backed pedagogies</em>,&nbsp;facilitated <em>job-embedded&nbsp;training</em>&nbsp;to
build and strengthen teachers’ capacity and professional competencies as
21st century teachers for future-ready learners. The theory-practice nexus
was also strongly advocated through the provision of a 6-hour Practice
Study,&nbsp;a post-workshop activity which promoted invaluable ground-level
feedback and guided application of the theory to actual classroom practice.
In 2020, RGS PeRL Consultancy ceased its services and was replaced by PEDTALKS.</p>

<p>In <strong>2021</strong>, RGS PeRL witnessed the launch of a new initiative, <strong>PEDTALKS</strong>,
&nbsp;a series of <strong>live chat conversations</strong> that harnesses
the power of practitioner knowledge and experience to generate new insights
and understandings into classroom practices.</p>
<p>PEDTALKS is grounded on <strong>Lev</strong>  <strong>Vygotsky's Sociocultural Theory of Cognitive Development</strong> (1934)
which focuses on the important role played by <strong>social interaction</strong> in&nbsp;<strong>learning</strong>.
Interacting with other people has proven to be quite effective in assisting
the learner to organise their thoughts, reflect on their understanding,
and find gaps in their reasoning. This is further propounded&nbsp; by <strong>Malcolm Knowles’ Andragogy</strong> or <strong>Adult Learning Theory</strong> (1968)
which suggests that adults are task-oriented, life-focused and problem-centric
in their approach to learning. At professional learning sessions, they
bring a wealth of experience and practical knowledge that can serve as
a valuable resource through the sharing of personal beliefs, practical
challenges and success from their own classrooms. By expanding teacher
conversations across schools, teachers can collaborate and learn from one
another to enhance their professional growth and improve their instructional
practice.</p>
<p>Each year, a pedagogical strand is identified and two PEDTalk sessions
are organised based on the strand - one session features a sharing by an
expert and another session features sharings by classroom practitioners.
At the end of the two sessions, participants may choose to apply what they
have learnt by participating in a small group Practice Circle where learning
takes the form of application, collaboration and sharing of practical solutions.

<p>In this way, learning is sustained and enriched through the contextual
and authentic nature of what is being applied in the classrooms.</p>
