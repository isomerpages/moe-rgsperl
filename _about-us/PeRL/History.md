## History

<img src="/images/This Is It.jpg" style="width:%" align="">

The Pedagogical Research Lab (PeRL) was launched in RGS on 28 August 2010 by Mrs Tan Ching Yee, the-then Permanent Secretary of Education. The aim was to engender school-based inquiry into pedagogy and practice as well as to offer consultancy.

PeRLâ€™s unique feature is the creation of the Specialist track. The Teacher-Specialists conduct Academic Research that informs curricular practices as well as steer Practitioner Inquiry amongst teachers. We have conducted Inquiry into multiple domains ranging from Instructional strategies, Assessment modes and technology-enhanced learning. Our data is ploughed back to practice, strengthening theory-practice nexus. Importantly, this posture of Inquiry and consensus-building on teaching standards nurtures teacher professionalism.

In 2014, the Teaching track was also incorporated into PeRL. With this expanded professional learning ecosystem, PeRL was renamed as the Centre for Pedagogical Research and Learning. Our Teacher Leaders coach, mentor and train colleagues in learning strategies and mindsets that empower and engage the learner. Led by the Head of Professional Development, they uphold our strong professional learning culture.

We have worked with other educators through platforms like customized workshops, Open Classroom, Teacher Exchange, the biennial Reflective Practitioner Symposium and since, 2020, the PEDTALKS. These interactions have enabled knowledge sharing, collective problem-solving and co-teaching. We ceased Consultancy in 2020.

In 2022, we renewed our collaboration with the National Institute of Education, enabling powerful conversations and knowledge sharing on topics like Blended Learning, Collaborative Learning and Differentiated Instruction.

We are aware that the Information Revolution requires adaptive expertise and sinewy responses to new ways of thinking and functioning. What remains unchanged, we assert, is Learner Responsiveness. Powerful pedagogies and reflective practice, therefore, continue to be essential.

In the end, our goal is not only support good pedagogy but also to nurture fulfilled, satisfied professionals who take delight in quality learning.
