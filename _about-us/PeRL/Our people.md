She works with a team comprising the Head of Professional Development, Lead Teachers, Senior Teachers and Teacher Specialists, including  a (PeRL) Executive. PeRL’s uniqueness lies in its provision of the Specialist track for teachers, an alternative career pathway to the Teaching and Leadership tracks. The work of the RGS Specialists facilitates a stronger interface between educational research and classroom improvement thus strengthening the theory-practice nexus in research.
