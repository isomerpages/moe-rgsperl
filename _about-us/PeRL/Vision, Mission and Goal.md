<p>RGS PeRL aspires to nurture practitioners who intuitively inquire about
their classroom practices and who reflect and develop respect for learner
diversity, open-mindedness and responsibility, traits which John Dewey
(1933) describes as the ‘moral dimension’ to reflective practice.</p>
<p>PeRL provides platforms for professional discourse that contributes to
the educational fraternity.</p>
<p>Our overarching purpose is articulated in our philosophy, "Uncovering
Wisdom through Pedagogy". This belief reflects our desire to harness knowledge
for the common good.</p>
