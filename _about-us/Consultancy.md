RGS PeRL Consultancy endeavors to create a **_practitioner-oriented_** learning environment by offering a wide variety of professional development workshops that cater to teachers' needs as adult learners. Our workshops, which focus on **_evidence-backed pedagogies_**, facilitate **_job-embedded training_** to build and strengthen teachers’ capacity and professional competencies to enhance students’ learning experiences and to equip students with the relevant knowledge, skills and values for living and working in the 21st Century.

 Upholding the belief that people learn best by doing, RGS PeRL Consultancy provides a **_6-hour Practice Study_**, a post-workshop activity which allows for invaluable ground-level feedback and guided application of the theory to actual classroom practice. In brief, the **_theory-practice nexus_** is strongly emphasized and embraced by RGS PeRL Consultancy.

 RGS PeRL Consultancy also provides invaluable opportunities for academic engagement, collaborative work and professional discourse on pedagogical approaches to Gifted Education (especially for  Asian girls) in Asia and beyond.
