## VISION, MISSION AND GOAL

RGS PeRL aspires to nurture practitioners who intuitively inquire about their classroom practices and who reflect and develop respect for learner diversity, open-mindedness and responsibility, traits which John Dewey (1933) describes as the ‘moral dimension’ to reflective practice.

PeRL provides platforms for professional discourse that contributes to the educational fraternity.

Our overarching purpose is articulated in our philosophy, "Uncovering Wisdom through Pedagogy". This belief reflects our desire to harness knowledge for the common good.
