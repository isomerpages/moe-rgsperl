She works with a team comprising the Heads of Consultancy and Professional Development, Lead Teachers, Specialists which include a Senior Research Executive, and Senior Teachers. PeRLâ€™s uniqueness lies in its provision of the Specialist track for teachers, an alternative career pathway to the Teaching and Leadership tracks. The work of the RGS Specialists facilitates a stronger interface between educational research and classroom improvement, strengthening the theory-practice nexus in research.
