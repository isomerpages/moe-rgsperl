## PERSONNEL

RGS PeRL is helmed by a Deputy Principal who drives its strategic agenda and operations. She works with a team comprising the Heads of Consultancy and Professional Development, Lead Teachers, Specialists which include a Senior Research Executive, and Senior Teachers. PeRL’s uniqueness lies in its provision of the Specialist track for teachers, an alternative career pathway to the Teaching and Leadership tracks. The work of the RGS Specialists facilitates a stronger interface between educational research and classroom improvement, strengthening the theory-practice nexus in research.
