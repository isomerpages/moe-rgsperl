#### PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN RGS: NURTURING THE ADEPT TEACHER OF THE HIGHLY ABLE GIRL

One of the stretch goals of the school is to be a world-class institution for the education of gifted and talented girls, recognized locally and internationally.

In line with this, the RGS Professional Development Plan-2 (PDP-2)[\[1\]](https://www.rgs.edu.sg/about-us/professional-development#_ftn1) **PAGE NOT FOUND**Â aims to develop and retain staff with the necessary competencies and dispositions to cultivate professional discourse and viewpoints that engage, create and challenge learning. An on-going review process ensures constant feedback, analysis and refinement of the quality of teaching.
