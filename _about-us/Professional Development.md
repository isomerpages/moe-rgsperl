<h2>Professional Development in RGS: Nurturing The Adept Teacher of The Highly Able Girl</h2>
<p>The RGS Professional Development Plan-2 (PDP-2) aims to develop and retain
staff with the necessary competencies and dispositions to cultivate professional
discourse and viewpoints that engage, create and challenge learning. An
ongoing review process ensures constant feedback, analysis and refinement
of the quality of teaching.</p>
<h3>Professional Learning of RGS Education Officers</h3>
<p>Definition: Professional Development Plan and Professional Learning</p>
<p><u>Professional Development Plan</u> refers to the overall, whole-school
system of staff development.</p>
<p><u>Professional Learning</u> refers to teachers’ ongoing learning as they
create their own knowledge about their practice and use student outcomes
to plan and reflect on their practices. Work is interlaced with learning
within a collaborative culture.</p>
<p>Both Professional Development (PD) and Professional Learning are systematic
and intentional.</p>
<h4>Rationale for Professional Learning</h4>
<p>Research shows that quality teaching enables quality learning. In line
with this, Professional Learning focuses on providing the conditions for
all to learn, including school management and teachers. The school gives
time and space for collaboration on lesson design and data-driven instruction
as well as mentoring and coaching. With the student at the center of this
process, Professional Learning creates a culture of collective learning
and hence, deepens the social capital.</p>
<h4>Beliefs</h4>
<p>The PD plan is based on a set of beliefs and values about teaching and
learning as articulated in the following ways:</p>
<p>1 . RGS educators view student learning as a <strong>collective</strong> responsibility
<br>2 . <strong>Sustained</strong> professional learning contributes to quality
teaching
<br>3 . Teams engage in a <strong>continuous cycle</strong> of improvement because
they want to improve their practice
<br>4 . <strong>Student learning needs</strong> define educators’ learning needs</p>
<p>These beliefs have largely endured in RGS over time.</p>
<h4>Features of RGS' Professional Learning</h4>
<p>Literature indicates that a well-developed Professional Learning Plan
consists of the following principles:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Professional learning_updated" src="/images/Professional_Learning.png">
</div>
<p>1 . <u>Aligned to curriculum standards and national goals :</u> The goals
and standards are explicitly stated so that faculty members organize their
learning to achieve the larger purpose.</p>
<p>2 . <u>Collaborative :</u> Research shows that when teachers discuss their
classroom strategies, assessment and students’ work together, they develop
a sense of collective efficacy. As they discuss and learn from each other,
they hone their competences and thereby, enhance student learning.</p>
<p>3 . <u>School-based&nbsp;:</u> Professional learning is facilitated by a
school-based team of leaders, mentors and Heads. The professional conversations
are therefore, contextual and are driven by a sense of collective responsibility
towards student learning. Where necessary, external expertise is sought
to enrich the knowledge and practice.</p>
<p>4 . <u>Job-embedded&nbsp;:</u> Research findings associate positive change
in educator practice with professional learning activities that focus not
only on curriculum content but the&nbsp;<em>teaching and learning of that content</em>&nbsp;(Blank
&amp; de las Alas, 2009).</p>
<p>Knowledge of teaching is learned in practice (Ball &amp; Cohen, 1999).
It is connected to practice and is iterative.</p>
<p>Teachers take note not only of what they teach but also, how they have
done so. They examine students’ learning in terms of the desired outcomes
and use the feedback to further hone their practice. As Smylie (2010) noted,
“We will fail … to improve schooling for children until we acknowledge
the importance of schools not only as places for teachers to work but also
as places for teachers to learn” (p. 92).</p>
<p>5 . <u>Data-driven&nbsp;:</u> Pedagogical decisions are based on triangulated
data on student performance. Professional learning is therefore, outcomes-focused.
Assessment is valued for its data on the teaching–learning relationship.</p>
<h3>Evaluation of Professional Learning</h3>
<p>Evidence that directly correlates professional learning with student achievement
is thin. Given the complexities of human motivations and classroom dynamics,
this is understandable. Current research only suggests that a well-developed
PD Plan influences teacher practice and student performance but a causal
relationship is not established.</p>
<p>Moreover, professional learning includes outcomes that go beyond student
learning. These include professional interaction amongst staff, mentoring
of new teachers and practitioner inquiry. These activities contribute to
staff morale, capacity- building and collegiality which should be valued
for their intrinsic worth.</p>
<p>In fact, OECD quotes the Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle <a href="https://www.rgs.edu.sg/about-us/professional-development#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a>&nbsp;to
warn PD planners on the ‘corrupting and distorting’ effects of quantitative
indicators for what is largely, a social process.</p>
<p>Thus, for now, the quality of RGS’ Professional learning is evaluated
using evidence–backed standards for professional learning,&nbsp;<u>focusing on the processes and outcomes of teacher learning</u>&nbsp;rather
than to establish a causal relationship between professional learning and
student achievement. Meanwhile, through in-house research and scan of research
elsewhere, this relationship will be attempted.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the multifacetedness of Teaching and Learning, multiple
measures are accordingly used to evaluate professional learning. These
include the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Classroom Observation Scale-Revised (adapted from College of William and
Mary, USA)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student performance data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teacher and student surveys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qualitative evidence: anecdotes; observations; interviews</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The data contributes to training plans, in-house research and strategic
directions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The in-house SING approach facilitates a segmentised professional learning
plan.</p>
