## PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

#### PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN RGS: NURTURING THE ADEPT TEACHER OF THE HIGHLY ABLE GIRL

One of the stretch goals of the school is to be a world-class institution for the education of gifted and talented girls, recognized locally and internationally.

In line with this, the RGS Professional Development Plan-2 (PDP-2)[\[1\]](https://www.rgs.edu.sg/about-us/professional-development#_ftn1) **PAGE NOT FOUND** aims to develop and retain staff with the necessary competencies and dispositions to cultivate professional discourse and viewpoints that engage, create and challenge learning. An on-going review process ensures constant feedback, analysis and refinement of the quality of teaching.

#### PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OF RGS EDUCATION OFFICERS

Definition: Professional Development Plan and Professional Learning

<u>Professional Development Plan</u> refers to the overall, whole-school system of staff development.

<u>Professional Learning</u> refers to teachers’ on-going learning as they create their own knowledge about their practice and use student outcomes to plan and reflect on their practices. Work is interlaced with learning within a collaborative culture.

Both Professional Development (PD) and Professional Learning are systematic and intentional.

Rationale for Professional Learning<br>
Research shows that quality teaching enables quality learning. In line with this, Professional Learning focuses on providing the conditions for all to learn, including school management and teachers. The school gives time and space for collaboration on lesson design and data-driven instruction as well as mentoring and coaching. With the student at the center of this process, Professional Learning creates a culture of collective learning and hence, deepens the social capital.

Beliefs<br>
The PD plan is based on a set of beliefs and values about teaching and learning as articulated in the following ways:

1 \.  RGS educators view student learning as a **collective** responsibility<br>
2 \.  **Sustained** professional learning contributes to quality teaching<br>
3 \.  Teams engage in a **continuous cycle** of improvement because they want to improve their practice<br>
4 \.  **Student learning needs** define educators’ learning needs
