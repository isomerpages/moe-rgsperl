<p>Science inquiry-based learning (IBL) often adopts a student-centred approach
that requires teachers to design the IBL activities as well as employ facilitation
strategies to guide students in their inquiry. This workshop aims to provide
teachers with a series of teaching actions that allow students to work
collaboratively to achieve the learning goals of inquiry-based learning.
With the use of these teaching actions, students assume different roles
to cross-examine scientific concepts or data in small groups. Interest
is differentiated in the role playing process and instruction is further
differentiated based on readiness by providing students with different
types of Socratic questions in the inquiry process to support student metacognition.
In this IBL approach, teachers play the role of facilitators who guide
students in their inquiry process to achieve the criteria of success. This
collaborative learning experience has been used in Biology, Chemistry and
Physics IBLs in Raffles Girls’ School (Secondary), with the IBL activities
ranging from exploring a phenomenon to analysing data and evidence. On
the whole, both teachers and students have responded positively to the
teaching actions in these IBLs based on the data gathered from teachers,
students and third party observations. Students have been able to achieve
the learning outcomes with a deeper level of conceptual understanding.
In addition, the use of Socratic questions in the collaborative learning
process played a role in developing students’ intellectual traits.</p>

<p>Since 2021, with the implementation of the new Chinese syllabus which
places strong emphasis on self-directed learning, as well as the introduction
of iPad as student’s personal learning devices in RGS, the RGS Secondary
1 Higher Chinese team from the Languages department embarked on process
writing and peer review in the teaching of Narrative Writing. ICT tools
and platforms such as google document, Student Learning Space and Apple
Pencil are used in the writing and peer review process. In 2022, the Secondary
1 Higher Chinese team began an Action Research on the effectiveness of
using technology in peer review on Secondary 1 Higher Chinese Students
Narrative Writing skills. Through comparing pre and post essay results,
level-wide survey, as well as face-to-face interviews with teachers and
students, this research aims to find out: 1) Does ICT-enhanced Peer Review
help students to understand the requirement of Narrative Writing? 2) Does
ICT-enhanced Peer Review help students to improve their Narrative Writing
skills' 3) What are Teachers’ and Students’ feedback on the ICT-enhanced
Peer Review process' This presentation will share the process on how the
team implemented the ICT-enhanced peer review in our teaching and some
takeaways from using ICT tools in process writing and peer review. This
presentation can be presented in English or Chinese. (Examples are in Chinese)</p>

<summary><strong>Learner’s experience in a blended learning environment: an exploratory study in a secondary school</strong>

<p>This study explores learners' perceptions and experiences in a blended
learning environment, aiming to uncover the challenges they face and ways
in which the school can provide support. This study employed a single-case
mixed-methods research design, utilising a survey with Likert-scale and
open-ended questions, as well as focus group discussions. This approach
aimed to document students' experiences in both asynchronous and synchronous
lessons, both inside and outside the classroom, within a secondary school
setting. While there is ample research on blended learning in higher education,
there aren't many instruments tailored to the specific needs of secondary
school students. The existing literature tends to focus on student engagement
without providing comprehensive instruments for secondary schools. To address
this gap, key studies by Graham et al. (2006 &amp; 2019), Ginns and Ellis
(2007), Bouilheres et al. (2020), Bhagat et al. (2021), and UCF &amp; AASCU
(2017) were leveraged, and school management input and expert consultations
were sought to adapt the instrument accurately to the secondary school
context. To ensure the validity of the survey instrument, a pre-testing
phase was conducted with a representative subsample of students. Input
from experts further informed its face validity and construct validity
and alignment with the intended constructs. Additionally, exploratory and
confirmatory factor analyses were performed as part of the validation process.
A total of 526 students in Secondary 2 to 4 participated in the survey,
with a subset of 18 students from various subject combinations also taking
part in the focus group discussions. Findings from this study revealed
a strong baseline of blended learning, with students generally managing
well and expressing satisfaction with their blended learning experiences.
The challenges identified underscore the importance of teachers' purposeful
planning and their awareness of students' lived experiences. The insights
in this research will be of particular interest to educators looking to
gain a deeper understanding of students' perceptions of their blended learning
environment. The survey instrument can serve as a valuable tool for educators
to gather feedback, inform instructional design while incorporating elements
of blended learning, and enhance the overall blended learning experience
for secondary school students.</p>
