## SPSS LOAN SERVICE

<img src="/images/spss.jpg" style="width:30%" align=left>

RGS PeRL is pleased to extend loan services for SPSS software to RGS staff. This service entails the loan of a single standalone SPSS licence for use on a personal computer for a stipulated period of time.<br><br>

As SPSS is an expensive resource and the number of standalone licenses are limited, loans are subject to approval on a needs basis. Please access the [SPSS Loan Policy](/files/SPSS%20Loan%20Policy%20for%20RGS%20Staff_April%202015.pdf) document for more information.

Click [here](https://inet.rgs.edu.sg/staff/PeRL/PeRL-Office/Lists/SPSS_Loan/AllItems.aspx) to submit a loan request. Requests should be submitted at least 1 week prior to the loan date which you have indicated in the form.

We hope that you will find this service useful for your professional development needs. For any enquiries or feedback, drop us an email at [rgs.perl@rafflesgirlssch.edu.sg](mailto:rgs.perl@rafflesgirlssch.edu.sg).
