<h4>School-based Training</h4>
<p>School-based training centres on enhancing teachers’ professional practices
and ongoing reflection. The aim is to nurture the adept, reflective teacher
of the highly able learner.</p>
<p>As a school for gifted and talented, the RGS Professional Development
Plan therefore, focuses on the following core competencies:</p>
<p>1 . Gifted &amp; Talented pedagogies such as&nbsp;<em>Critical Thinking, Creative Thinking, Differentiation strategies, Concept attainment strategies, Inquiry-driven instruction</em> 
<br>2 . Curriculum Design Framework such as Understanding by Design (UbD),
Lynn Erickson’s concept-based learning principles
<br>3 . Practitioner Inquiry
<br>4 . Assessment Literacy: Assessment principles, Formative &amp; Summative
assessments, Design of the Performance Task
<br>5 . Learning Technologies</p>
<h4>Induction Programme</h4>
<p>The Professional Learning Academy provides a 2-year Induction Programme
for teachers new to RGS. The programme aims to (a) provide support to the
teachers as they adjust to the new environment and (b) train them in the
pedagogical content knowledge and skills appropriate to the school’s student
profile.</p>
<p>The core of the induction programme is the relationship between the new
teachers and a Mentor, who is usually the Senior Teacher. Each teacher
works with his/ her Mentor to set goals, collect and analyse classroom
evidence, plan and reflect on lessons. The focus on the teachers’ craft
and well-being ensures that the partnership may lead to a positive learning
experience for both the teacher-mentors and mentees.</p>
