#### INDUCTION PROGRAMME

The Professional Learning Academy provides a 2-year Induction Programme for teachers new to RGS. The Programme aims to (a) provide support to the teachers they adjust to the new environment and (b) train them in the pedagogical content knowledge and skills appropriate to the school’s student profile.

The core of the induction programme is the relationship between the new teachers and a Mentor, who is usually the Senior Teacher. Each teacher works with his/ her Mentor to set goals, collect and analyze classroom evidence, plan and reflect on lessons. The focus on the teachers’ craft and well-being ensures that the partnership may lead to a positive learning experience for both the teacher-mentors and mentees.
