<p>To ensure that professional learning outcomes are robust and sustainable,
the school schedules a weekly Professional Learning Space (PLS) in the
curriculum. During this time, the entire teaching faculty, including the
Senior Management, is involved in professional discourse. This promotes
a sense of collective responsibility for quality teaching and learning.</p>
<p>We use the Create-Implement-Review cycle to guide the discourse. Central
to this cycle is the focus on&nbsp;<em>evidence</em>&nbsp;of student learning.
Using protocols to guide unit design, lesson delivery and review, we examine
whether our practices are based on established standards and how these
practices have contributed to student achievement. This process of reflective
inquiry engenders a ‘reframing’ (Schon, 1983) mindset in which we make
sense of situations with perspectives other than our own.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows the Create-Implement-Review Cycle that guides
PLS&nbsp;&nbsp;discourse at RGS.</p>

<h4>PLS Discourse</h4>
<p>RGS’ Curriculum Maps are concept-based. To maintain relevance and robustness,
we are currently reviewing our Curriculum Maps, improving our Enduring
Understandings and Essential Questions while checking for the alignment
of these intended outcomes to classroom practice. A key focus for the year,
therefore, is the use of high-yielding strategies in the classroom that
facilitate content mastery and conceptual understanding. We are reviving
the use of enduring pedagogical tools like graphic organizers and concept
development model.</p>
