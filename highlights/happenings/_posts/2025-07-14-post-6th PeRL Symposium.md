<p>The 6th PeRL Symposium took place on 11 July 2025, bringing together a
vibrant community of educators from various schools who are committed to
deepening professional practice.</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2014, the RGS PeRL Symposium has provided a platform
for teacher-practitioners and educational researchers to exchange ideas,
reflect on practice, and advance pedagogical research in Singapore.</p>
<p>This year’s theme, “Empowering Learners to Thrive”, encouraged participants
to reimagine success in education. Rather than focusing solely on academic
outcomes, the symposium explored how schools can foster student engagement,
resilience, and a sense of purpose to help learners grow and contribute
meaningfully to society.</p>
<p>The keynote address by Mr Chng Kai Fong, Permanent Secretary at the Ministry
of Digital Development and Information and the Prime Minister’s Office
(Cybersecurity), offered timely insights into the future of learning and
the importance of digital fluency in preparing students for a changing
world. The PEDTalk by Dr Betsy Ng explored how autonomy-supportive teaching
can enhance student motivation, engagement, and self-regulation. She shared
practical strategies grounded in Self-Determination Theory that help foster
learner agency in the classroom. Participants also engaged in concurrent
sessions and dialogue forums that featured diverse teacher-led research
and innovations in teaching and learning.</p>
<p>We thank all presenters and participants for their thoughtful contributions.
Together, we continue to grow a reflective and forward-looking professional
community that places learners at the heart of education.</p>
