We're thrilled to announce that after an incredible 20-week run from Term 2 to Term 3, this year's Open Classroom series has officially concluded. As a vital part of our commitment to professional growth, 25 dedicated teachers at RGS graciously opened their classrooms, welcoming a remarkable total of 72 attendees.

The Open Classroom series offers a unique opportunity for teachers to gain valuable insights and feedback, enabling them to enhance and refine their teaching methods. By actively engaging with attendees, our teachers receive constructive feedback that helps them evolve and improve their instructional techniques. 

Additionally, this program encourages teachers to visit each other's classrooms, fostering a collaborative environment where alternative strategies, fresh ideas, and new insights into teaching practices can be explored.

We're incredibly proud of our teachers' dedication to continuous improvement and their willingness to share their expertise!
