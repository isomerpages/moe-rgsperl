The 5th PeRL Symposium took place on 30 June 2023, marking another successful gathering of educators at the RGS Campus.

The RGS PeRL Symposium was first established in 2014, with the primary objective of fostering collaboration among educators, sharing best practices, and facilitating meaningful discussions about teaching and learning. The bi-annual symposium aims to encourage reflective practice and provide a platform for advancing teacher research in Singapore.

This year’s symposium revolved around the theme of “Advancing Pedagogies to Steward Educational Change”. Educators from various institutions delved into the crucial topic of leveraging pedagogical approaches to drive positive transformations in education.

The highlight of the symposium was the invigorating plenary session on “Technology and Education’s Next Frontier” led by Associate Professor Victor Lim Fei and Ms. Fiona Lee. They shed light on the exciting prospects and emerging trends at the intersection of technology and education. Attendees were also offered the opportunity to engage in concurrent sessions and a stimulating forum, covering a wide array of topics presented by esteemed speakers.

We extend our heartfelt appreciation to the dedicated presenters and all the enthusiastic participants for their valuable contributions. Together, we continue to pave the way for a brighter future in education.
