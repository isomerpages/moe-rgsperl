<p>Learning never stops!</p>
<p>Our dedicated educators are back in the classroom, but this time as learners
at our biennial Good Practice Day (GPD)!</p>
<p>GPD is our unique in-house event featuring teacher-led workshops and presentations.
These platforms are designed to cultivate teacher leaders by encouraging
the exchange of innovative ideas and keeping everyone updated on the latest
developments in education.</p>
<p>Our educators engaged in a variety of insightful workshops and presentations.
It was an invaluable opportunity to learn from one another, enhance our
pedagogical strategies, and ultimately, make a positive impact on our students'
learning experiences.</p>
