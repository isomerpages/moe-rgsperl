The second gathering of PedTalk’s ‘Enhancing Teachers’ Data Practices to Impact Teaching and Learning’ series took place on 22 August 2023, bringing together innovative educators from various schools to our Braddell Campus to explore the effective utilisation of data in education.

PEDTalk was launched in 2021 as a series of teacher conversations that harness the power of teacher expertise and classroom experience to generate fresh insights and understanding into what works for each classroom context. Two PEDTalk sessions are conducted each year, attracting a participation of approximately 140 teachers across four sessions since its inception in 2021.

In this PEDTalk session, teachers explored the collection and utilisation of student data to help them review lesson effectiveness, differentiate instruction and personalise students’ learning with the goal to help all students progress.

The session kicked off with presentations by 3 teachers who shared their data practices in their respective classrooms. These were followed by table discussions where participants shared their own classroom experiences, exchanged practical strategies, and collaboratively brainstormed new ideas that could be implemented in their own classrooms.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all who actively participated in this productive PedTalk session. By fostering open dialogue and cultivating a sense of community, events like this empower teachers as catalysts for positive change. Our students will undoubtedly benefit as these meaningful discussions continue to sow the seeds of growth, enabling the optimisation of teaching and learning through the effective analysis of classroom data.
