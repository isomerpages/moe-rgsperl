## ABOUT THE SESSION

**IMAGE NOT ABLE TO LOAD**

**Reflection on practice is a natural part of being a teacher and represents the most effective and sustainable agent of educational improvement. In this regard, PEDTALKS aim to promote reflective practice through informal conversations amongst teachers. By expanding conversations across different schools, teachers can deepen their social networks to enhance professional learning and build a collaborative culture that will strengthen the social capital within the fraternity.**
